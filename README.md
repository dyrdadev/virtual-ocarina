# Virtual Ocarina

> Virtual ocarina flute for mobile platforms.

The "Virtual Ocarina" is a virtual instrument for mobile platforms that support multi-touch and microphone input. The project is developed with Unity. It was originally created for use in lectures at the university to teach the principles of simple audio input and bitmasks.

## Playing the Virtual Ocarina

Blow into the microphone to produce sounds. Press the keys to create different tones. Different key combinations produce different tones. The combinations are based on a real four-hole ocarina. Currently, we are only considering the key combination of the major scale. Filled circles mean pressed keys (closed holes on a real ocarina), empty circles mean non-pressed keys (open holes on a real ocarina):
